//Ternary Operator

//A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

//Syntax: 
// condition ? expression1 : expression2

//If the condition evaluates to true then expression1 is executed. 
//If the condition evaluates to false then expression2 is executed.

//Ternary operator is also known as conditional operator

//Example 1

//let age = 15;


//let result = (age >= 18) ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not Elibile";

//console.log(result);

//Example 2

//let marks = prompt("Please enter your marks: ");

//let result = (marks >= 60) ? "Passed" : "Failed";

//console.log(`You ${result} the exam`);

//Example 3

//Nested ternary operators

//We can nest one ternary operator as an expression inside another ternary operator.

let a = 10;

let result = (a >= 0) ? (a == 0 ? "Zero" : "Positive") : "Negative";

console.log(`The number is ${result}`);
